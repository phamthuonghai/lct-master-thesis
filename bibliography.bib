	dependency parses from segmented and tokenized sequences of words. In order to
	address the rare word problem that abounds in languages with complex
	morphology, we include a character-based word representation that uses an LSTM
	to produce embeddings from sequences of characters. Our system was ranked first
	according to all five relevant metrics for the system: UPOS tagging (93.09%),
	XPOS tagging (82.27%), unlabeled attachment score (81.30%), labeled attachment
	score (76.30%), and content word labeled attachment score (72.57%).},
